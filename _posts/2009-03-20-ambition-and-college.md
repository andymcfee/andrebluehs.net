title: Ambition and College
---
Like many of my fellow students at Tech, I didn't have to work much through high school. I showed up to class and got my A (ok, maybe a B here or there). I was on cruise control and I'm positive there are alot of people who can relate. Then came college.

To quote Talladega Nights, "If you're not in first, you're in last". That is (for the most part) a very applicable philosophy here at Tech. Fortunately, I've come to terms with the fact that I'm mediocre at best. This, however, does not mean that I lack anything like ambition or drive or the will to succeed. I just accept that there are smarter people in the world than me. I try not to beat myself up for not being the best and the brightest. I've already proven I'm in the top echelon by getting this far.

###A Bit Of Ambition###

Having established that I'm a tad lazy, I can now point out that last summer was spent working for myself doing freelance design/production of websites. (seems to be the cool-kid thing to do for bored CS majors here). Now, however, I'm looking for a bit more of a steady income and am attempting to acquire a (real) job for this summer. This also takes a bit of ambition. Attending job fairs, sending out endless resumes, going on nerve wracking interviews. (As a side note, i didn't know you could spell wracking [with or without][1] the 'w'). Especially when you are a 3rd year CS major with no (real) internship and/or work experience under your belt.

About 3 months into my undergrad career here at Tech, I found myself already doing side projects. Learning new languages, trying things that weren't part of the homework assignment. It was then that I realized that yes, I am in the correct major. I'm a nerd, I love making computers do awesome things, I love wowing people and showing them the amazing capabilities of the machine sitting in front of them. Ask anyone who is successful in their respective field why they are successful, and without a doubt they will tell you it's because they enjoy what they do. Not only was it their ambition to succeed, but because they don't have to "work", it's fun.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is: I work hard at what I do because I love it. Please hire me?
