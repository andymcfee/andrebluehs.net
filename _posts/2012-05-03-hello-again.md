Hello, World. Again.

It's time to get some use back out of this blog. Also, i've rekindled my excitement with using it with my recent transition of it from Wordpress to Jekyll [the other night](https://twitter.com/#!/helloandre/status/197129127382364161).

I also had some time on my hands (read: needed to clear my head) so I played around with jekyll and ruby.

At first I wanted to patch jekyll to add a `--new` flag that would add a new post with a given title. But that was a bit over my head at first, so I started smaller. 

I ended up building [Quickpost](https://github.com/helloandre/quickpost). A mostly-trivial ruby script to quickly add a new post (yep, used it to start this one). Next step would be to make it into a ruby gem, and then to talk to the Jekyll community about adding it into Jekyll proper.

I'm going to try to do a weekly wednesday night post. For both people that still read it (hi mom!).
