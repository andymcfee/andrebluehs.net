Every once in a while I'll make a joke about my pet peeve being "[stupid people][1]". Let me qualify this by labelling "stupid" as "voluntarily stupid". Not people with a learning disability or genuine mental health issues, but the person who gets in the "10 items" line at the grocery store with a full cart. The person who argues that "irregardless" is a word. The person who takes 14 tries to park their car.

Even more specifically, I hate inefficient people.

I suppose this is a side effect of my day job. I spend the vast majority of my time while awake looking for the most efficient way to accomplish my goal. This has carried over noticably in my day to day activites. 

 - Wait until I finish with the bread *and* the jam so I only have to open the fridge door once.
 - While on my way to the store, I'll visualize the optimal path to take to get all the items in the shortest distance.
 
The other side of that is if I see someone doing something inefficient, but not necessarily wrong, I get frustrated with them. Typing one key at a time. Not using the "page up/down" button on the remote to select a channel.

This has completely or nearly ruined several relationships. Loading the dishwasher in an inefficient manner. Folding clothes in a way that is not the most compact.

It took me several years of claiming that I hated stupid people to realize that it wasn't hate at all, it was an unrealistic expectation. 

I consider myself moderately intelligent and converse with equally (and usually more) intelligent people all day. It becomes an echo chamber of smarts. I frequently forget that people I interact with that aren't in that group aren't less intelligent, but have different priorities. Also, they not have the same experience in clothes-folding that I do.

Not everyone in the world cares about making as few trips to the kitchen as possible, or the fastest way to open a soda can. These things aren't that big of a deal. In fact, it's pretty strange to even think about these things. 

##It's pretty strange to try and optimise every interaction.

This was the biggest revelation I had. *I'm* the weird one. I have the problem.

Since realizing this, I have become more conscious of becoming upset over minutiea. I'm not sure if it's nature (genetic predisposition for OCD) or nurture (an engineering mindset) that got me to this point. I have several engineers in my family who are fastidious and detail-oriented, and I went to an engineering school majoring in computer science. 

Either way, now that I've accepted that the world isn't completely full of idiots I don't have nearly as high a stress level on a daily basis.
