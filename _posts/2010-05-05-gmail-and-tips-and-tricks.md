title: Gmail Tip and Tricks

Did you know that you can modify your gmail address with and it will still reach you? Gmail ignores dots '.' and everything after a plus '+' sign.

This comes in extremely handy. Need to create several test accounts on your new web app? No problem! Just move around a dot in your address! Need to give an email address, but don't want to ever receive email from them? Tack a '+spam' on the end of your address and filter it to automatically be marked read and go to the trash.

Let's take a look at how to do this.

###The Dot

Gmail handily ignores all dots in the name part of your email address. andre.bluehs@gmail.com is exactly the same as andrebluehs@gmail.com is exactly the same as a.n.d.r.e.b.l.u.e.h.s@gmail.com. This is useful for signing up for accounts that require a unique email address, but you already have an account for (for testing, purposes, of course). All emails will go to your account, regardless of where and how many dots are in the name.

This also works for signing in to google. you can use your username without the @gmail part when logging into gmail. (This is not true for third party apps using your gmail identity for log in, such as stackoverflow, you need to provide your full email address)

###The Plus

This hack is extremely useful for 'tagging' email from certain places. If a site requires that you give an email address, simply put a +spam at the end of your username, and filter it. Note: you can put whatever you want after the +, i just use 'spam' here as an example. Gmail does not automatically filter things with '+spam' on the end, you must do this manually with the next step.

To create the appropriate filter, click on 'create new filter' next to the search button:

![create new filter][1]

Then put in the To: field, whatever your email address is, with a '+spam' for the username.

![+spam][2]

and finally, check 'mark as read' and 'delete it' in the last step.

![delete it][3]

and you're done! never to be pestered by 'affiliate email' again.

This can be repeated for any kinds of filters you want, as well as using the dot hack with this filtering hack to accomplish the same thing.
